"""Read-only inspection of what the config surface actually resolved to.

Answers "what am I pointed at" for both audiences the config serves: a bare install that
gets local stores with nothing said about it, and a deployment whose stage is whichever
file ``AGENT_ENV_CONFIG`` landed on. It reports the *resolution*, not the constructed
stores — no client is built, no network call is made, and nothing is written to disk.

Secret values cannot leak from here because nothing is interpolated: an ``env:`` /
``secret:`` reference is reported as the reference it is. Literal values under a
secret-shaped key, and the userinfo of a connection URI, are masked anyway — the schema
says secrets live behind references, but a report is the wrong place to find out otherwise.
